      <description>Table Topics and Speech Contest On December 5th, 2023 I had the pleasure to participate in two Toastmasters constests organized by my current club, First Class Toastmasters. The first contest was Table Topics, this is where you are given a prompt and have to give a mini speech about that prompt, there is no preparation and you don&amp;rsquo;t know that prompt until the very last moment. If there are other contestants, then they will have to wait outside the room where they can&amp;rsquo;t be hinted about what the prompt is.</description>

      <description>I won first prize in the talltales contest oganized by First Class Toastmasters in September 20th, 2023.&#xA;Tall Tales A tall tale is a story that contains unbelievable elements told as if they were true and factual. The book The Adventures of Baron Munchausen would be the greatest example of a compilation of tall tales as the main character Baron Munchausen tells stories of his travels exagerating the truth a tiny bit.</description>
