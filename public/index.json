If there are other contestants, then they will have to wait outside the room where they can\u0026rsquo;t be hinted about what the prompt is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe second contest was the speech contest. For this every contestant can be present, you are allowed to have a prepared speech and you are given more time to tell your story. In the end you will be graded based on certain criteria and you win depending on your final score. I was beyond thrilled to be the winner on both contests! This motivates me to improve my skills more because I am now curious as to how far I can go.","description":"","image":"/images/intercrop.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/tabletopicsspeech/","title":"Table Topics and Speech Contest"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI won first prize in the talltales contest oganized by First Class Toastmasters in  September 20th, 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"tall-tales\"\u003eTall Tales\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall tale is a story that contains unbelievable elements told as if they were true and factual. The book The Adventures of Baron Munchausen would be the greatest example of a compilation of tall tales as the main character Baron Munchausen tells stories of his travels exagerating the truth a tiny bit. I seriously recommend this book, it is a solid read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs a member of Toastmasters Internation I am allowed to participate in contests.
