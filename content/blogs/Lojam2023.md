## London Gamejam

From October 21st to October 28th, 2023 I participated in 
<br>
In this event you are given a week to create a video game based on a certain theme.
This year's theme was growth.
I created a prototype for a stealth game where you are trying to infiltrate a building on fire to retrieve a very important item from your apartment.
I admitedly bit more than I could chew and unfortunately, my game was not finish on time.

<br>
There were lots of cool projects and a plenty of talented people showcasing their games and skills!
Here is a video for the trailer of the game I made.
