## Table Topics and Speech Contest

On December 5th, 2023 I had the pleasure to participate in two Toastmasters constests organized by my current club, First Class Toastmasters.
The first contest was Table Topics, this is where you are given a prompt and have to give a mini speech about that prompt, there is no preparation and you don't know that prompt until the very last moment. If there are other contestants, then they will have to wait outside the room where they can't be hinted about what the prompt is.

The second contest was the speech contest. For this every contestant can be present, you are allowed to have a prepared speech and you are given more time to tell your story. In the end you will be graded based on certain criteria and you win depending on your final score. I was beyond thrilled to be the winner on both contests! This motivates me to improve my skills more because I am now curious as to how far I can go.
